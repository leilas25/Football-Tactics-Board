## ‚ú® Project Overview

This project is an interactive Football Tactics Board application built using Python and the Pygame library. It provides a simple, intuitive interface for users to visualize and plan football strategies by dragging and dropping player icons across a football pitch.

This application demonstrates fundamental concepts in GUI development, event handling, and object-oriented programming within a game-like environment.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Python:** The core programming language for the application logic.
  
* **Pygame:** A set of Python modules designed for writing video games, used here for graphics rendering, event handling, and managing the application window.

---

## üåü Key Features

* **Interactive Player Icons:** Player icons for two teams (Team 1 and Team 2) can be clicked and dragged anywhere on the board.
* **Football Pitch Background:** A visually clear football pitch image serves as the main background.
  
* **Responsive Player Movement:** Smooth and responsive dragging functionality for player icons.
  
* **Simple GUI:** A clean and straightforward graphical user interface.
  
* **Object-Oriented Design:** Implements `PlayerIcon` and `TacticsBoard` classes for modular and organized code.

## üìã How to Run Locally

To get this Football Tactics Board running on your local machine:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Ensure you have Python installed (Python 3.x is recommended).
    * You'll need the Pygame library.

2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/leilas25/Football-Tactics-Board.git](https://github.com/leilas25/Football-Tactics-Board.git)
    ```

3.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Football-Tactics-Board
    ```
    *(Make sure your `tactic-board.py`, `images` folder, and `utils.py` (if you have one) are all within this directory.)*

4.  **Install Pygame:**
    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```
    *(If you have a `requirements.txt` file, you can use `pip install -r requirements.txt` instead.)*

5.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python tactic-board.py
    ```
    A new window should open displaying the Football Tactics Board.

## üí° What I Learned

* **Pygame Fundamentals:** Gained hands-on experience with Pygame for initializing, creating windows, loading/scaling images, and handling basic drawing operations.
  
* **Event Handling:** Implemented mouse event handling (`MOUSEBUTTONDOWN`, `MOUSEBUTTONUP`,
